    <h1>Delicious Sausage Stuffing</h1>
    <p>This stuffing has lots of flavor and is nice and moist.<br>
        You can also change the ingredients to your liking. </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound breakfast sausage</li>
        <li>¾ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups finely diced celery</li>
        <li>¾ cup margarine, melted</li>
        <li>8 cups white bread cubes</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Cook sausage. Drain.</p></li>
        <li><p>Melt margarine. Add enough to sausage drippings to make 1 cup.</p></li>
        <li><p>Saute; onions and celery in margarine/dripping mixture until onion is tender.<br>
            DO NOT BROWN. Stir in about 1/3 bread cubes. Put in big bowl and add remaining <br>
            bread cubes, poultry seasoning, and pepper. Watch your hands, it's hot. Mix well.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stuff turkey. You can also omit the sausage, increase the bread cubes to 9 cups,<br>
            and add a teaspoon or two of salt. You can also add apples, giblets, oysters, etc.<br>
             This recipe is very adaptable. When cooking extra in the oven, place the stuffing <br>
             in a buttered casserole dish, and place in a pan of hot water. Cover, and baste with<br>
             turkey drippings occasionally. It comes out really good.</p></li>
