    <h1>Tasty Turkey Brine</h1>
    <p>This is a tasty brine for any poultry. It will make your bird very juicy, and gravy to die for!!<br>
        This is enough brine for a 10 to 18 pound turkey.</p>
    <h1> Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 gallon vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 cup sea salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon crushed dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried sage</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried savory</li>
        <li>1 gallon ice water</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><p>In a large stock pot, combine the vegetable broth, sea salt, rosemary, sage, thyme,<br>
             and savory. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently to be sure salt is dissolved. Remove<br>
             from heat, and let cool to room temperature.</p></li>
        <li><p>When the broth mixture is cool, pour it into a clean 5 gallon bucket. Stir in the ice<br>
            water.</p></li>
        <li><p>Wash and dry your turkey. Make sure you have removed the innards. Place the turkey,<br>
             breast down, into the brine. Make sure that the cavity gets filled. Place the bucket in<br>
              the refrigerator overnight.</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove the turkey carefully draining off the excess brine and pat dry. Discard excess<br>
             brine.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook the turkey as desired reserving the drippings for gravy. Keep in mind that brined<br>
             turkeys cook 20 to 30 minutes faster so watch the temperature gauge.</p></li>
